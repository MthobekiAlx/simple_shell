.TH SHELLLY 1 "24 August 2023" "Mthobezi Sikhosana"
.SH NAME
.B shellly\fR \- artful UNIX command conductor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shellly\fR [\fIfilename\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Shellly\fR embodies the role of an artful conductor for UNIX commands. It thrives on orchestrating command symphonies from diverse sources, whether script scrolls or vocalized through standard input.

.B A Glance into the Shellly Symphony
.in +2n
\fBShellly\fR dons the garb of both interactive maestro and serene executor. When summoned with the ethereal standard input, it breathes life into commands like musical notes on a cosmic staff.

Yet, when summoned within the tapestry of a terminal, it unveils an interactive overture. A conductor, ready to heed your command crescendos, inviting the opening note, symbolized by \fI$ \fR.

Alternatively, if the invocation carries scrolls of command line as ancient scriptures, \fBShellly\fR treats the first scroll as a tome. Within this tome, each line unveils a command, and \fBShellly\fR weaves these commands into an orchestrated symphony, executed in harmonious succession.
.in

.B Environment Symphony
.in +2n
At the dawning invocation, \fBShellly\fR inherits the cosmic harmony from its ancestral process. This harmonious \fBenvironment\fR resonates as a chorus of \fIattribute-name\fR sonnets, where each note resembles \fINAME=VALUE\fR.
.in

.B Composition of Command Art
.in +2n
Upon receiving a command, \fBShellly\fR, the artistic composer, weaves lyrical words into an intricate tapestry. The first word serves as the conductor's baton, while the subsequent words harmonize as notes within the composition.

.B As the Score Unfolds

.RS
1. When the command's essence lacks the signature of a slash (\fI\\\fR) or the echo of a dot (\fI.\fR), \fBShellly\fR consults its anthology of melodic magic. If a lyrical spell is found, it directs the symphony to dance to its tune.
.RE

.RS
2. Should the command refrain from revealing slashes (\fI\\\fR) or dots (\fI.\fR), and remain uncharted by lyrical spells, \fBShellly\fR embarks on a serenade through the \fBPATH\fR alleys. Each alley, a realm of possible instrumental solos.
.RE

.RS
3. When the command's essence carries whispers of a slash (\fI\\\fR) or a dot (\fI.\fR), or aligns with the lore of the magical spells, \fBShellly\fR composes a gateway. This gateway ushers the named maestro, escorted by accompanying notes, into an auditory performance.
.RE

.B The Crescendo of Return
.in +2n
As the composition concludes, \fBShellly\fR takes its final bow, reciting tales spun by melodious commands. The climax of the opening note marks the conclusion, unveiling a triumphant exit status.

Should a lyrical spell remain unvoiced, \fBShellly\fR confers the mark of 127. And if the spell, though known, fails to enchant, the mark of 126 reverberates.

As the realm echoes, built-in sonnets echo triumph or woe, summoning returns of zero, one, or two, along with the resonance of error.
.in

.B Reverberating Signals
.in +2n
Within the realm of interactive invocation, \fBShellly\fR suspends the orchestra's pause button \fBCtrl+c\fR, granting a respite to the minstrels. However, the notes of \fBCtrl+d\fR conclude the symphony, bidding adieu to the performance.

.B Symphonic Note Substitution
.in +2n

.RE

.B Whispers in the Score
.in +2n
Within the symphony of notes, \fBShellly\fR heeds the whispers of \fI#\fR. Whispers preceding the \fI#\fR fade into obscurity, a silent offering to the unseen.

.B Harmonizing Musical Notations
.in +2n
